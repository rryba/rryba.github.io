I am game developer with nearly 10 years of experience working on games, mosty in Unity, C# and C++. Currently employed in Warsaw, Poland. My work mainly consists of creating tools for editor, Iâ€™m also familiar with robotics, electronics and programming microcontrollers. In my free time I develop my own games.

There is no part of the game development pipeline that I have not touched, I particlularly enjoy tools and gameplay programming where optimalization is core.

Please don't hesitate to contact me for any enquiries!
